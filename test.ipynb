The move comes after the Organization of American States passed a resolution Wednesday in hopes of easing tensions stemming from an attack by Colombian military on a rebel camp in neighboring Ecuador on Saturday. Since that attack, Ecuador has broken off relations with Colombia, and Venezuela says it has moved troops to its border with Colombia. Ortega made his televised remarks in Managua, where he was flanked by Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa. Colombian forces killed at least 17 members of the leftist group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia on Saturday. FARC is estimated to be holding at least 700 hostages in the jungles of Colombia and has been accused by the United States of being a terrorist organization. \"This rupture of relations isn't with the people of Colombia,\" Ortega said. \"We are breaking with the terrorist policies that the government of [Colombian President] Alvaro Uribe is practicing.\" In its resolution, the OAS called the attack \"a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ecuador and of principles of international law.\" It ordered a commission, headed by OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza and composed of four ambassadors designated by him, to visit both countries to investigate the matter, \"and to propose formulas for bringing the two nations closer together.\" Colombian officials have apologized for taking their attack against the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into Ecuador but said it was necessary to counter a threat to their national security. Colombian officials also said they discovered evidence after the attack that Ecuadoran and Venezuelan government officials were collaborating with the group -- namely that Chavez allegedly gave $300 million to the rebels and that a senior Ecuadoran official met with them. \"[They] are making things up and there's no limit to what they'll make up,\" Chavez said at a news conference on Wednesday. Correa has said his country would only be satisfied when the OAS issues a \"clear condemnation\" against Colombia for the raid. OAS foreign ministers are to meet March 17 in Washington \"to examine the facts and make the pertinent recommendations,\" the resolution concluded. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday that he saw little chance of war erupting between Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.  Learn more about the countries » . Gates added that the United States would not need to assist its Colombian allies should armed conflict break out. \"My personal view is that there is relatively little likelihood of a military conflict between them, and my further impression is that the Colombians can take care of themselves,\" he said at the Pentagon.

      "ID: 400, Score: 13.4126, Document: HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuban President Raul Castro is taking over leadership of a country whose government believes its citizens are not working hard enough. Raul Castro was chosen Sunday to take over Cuba's presidency from his brother, Fidel Castro. The state-run newspaper recently ran an article headlined \"Work: Option or necessity?\" The writer pointed out that, judging by the number of people in the streets during the day, many Cubans don't seem to be on the job. They have few motivations to buckle down: Salaries average about $15 per month on the island, and Cubans get monthly food rations even if they don't work.  Watch a report on the realities in Cuba » . \"There is a strong desire to protect and to gradually increase the incomes and savings of the population, particularly of those least favored,\" said Raul Castro, 76. The black market is so widespread that Cubans have coined a special term for breaking the law to make ends meet: \"resolver\" -- literally, \"to resolve.\"  See Cuba through I-Reporters' eyes » . The new president, who took the reins of power Sunday from his ailing brother, Fidel, 81, has said the country must become more productive. \"The country's priority will be to meet the basic needs of the population, both material and spiritual, based on the sustained strengthening of the national economy and its productive basis without which, I'll say it again, development would be impossible,\" Raul Castro said in a speech Sunday. Cubans, too, are calling for reforms, though not all of them related to productivity. In a recent video that has made the rounds on the Internet, a student poses tough questions to the president of Cuba's National Assembly, asking why Cubans cannot travel freely to resorts -- a practice derided by critics as \"tourist apartheid.\" Though such a public display of discontent is rare, the video echoed sentiments often voiced in private for years, particularly since the fall of the Soviet empire in 1991 and, with it, the loss of billions of dollars in subsidies. Cuban officials counter that Cubans are not granted access to the nation's most luxurious spots because they do not have the foreign exchange brought by the tourists and needed to run the country's social programs, such as free health care and education. With a new president steering the island nation for the first time in 49 years, some Cubans have allowed their expectations to rise. \"I think those expectations are really very large indeed and it'll be the Achilles heel, potentially, of this new government if it doesn't attack them with some vigor,\" said Hal Klepak, a professor of history and warfare studies at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. Indeed, Castro has promised to move within a few weeks to improve efficiency by cutting some of the red tape that can frustrate the most fervent of revolutionaries. But Wayne S. Smith, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington and chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana from 1979 to 1982, predicted Sunday in an editorial in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Raul Castro will not break strongly from his brother's policies. \"Rather, we will see a peaceful transition and the existing system remain largely intact,\" Smith predicted. Still, changes are inevitable, he said. \"Raul Castro has called for a nationwide debate on the country's economic future and for Cubans to propose reforms in group discussions. \"He has also called for new proposals to raise productivity, including discussion of more private ownership of land. The Cuban people want change, want reforms that will bring about a better way of life.\" Smith credited the younger Castro's leadership over the past 1½ years, while serving as acting president, with having already resulted in \"a greater openness, and open criticism of certain government programs.\" But the degree of change remains uncertain, as does the possibility that \"even from the shadow Fidel will try to discourage reforms,\" he said, adding \"the prognosis, nonetheless, is hopeful.\"  See a timeline of Castro's rise to power » . The U.S. government's former man in Havana recommended current politicians exert pressure on the island with a light touch. \"We could accomplish far more by reducing tensions and beginning a meaningful dialogue,\" he said. \"Raul Castro has several times suggested such a dialogue.

Robert Mugabe tries to stir voters with a blistering speech criticizing the U.S. and Britain. \"Zimbabwe cannot be British, it cannot be American. Yes, it is African,\" said Mugabe, whose speech Sunday was quoted Monday in The Herald, the state-run newspaper. \"You saw the joy that the British had, that the Americans had, and saw them here through their representatives celebrating and acting as if we Zimbabwe are either an extension of Britain or ...

The fallout from Zimbabwe's stalled election has brought international criticism, with Frazer taking the most emphatic stance. In April, Frazer accused Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly three decades, of \"trying to steal the election\" and \"intimidating the population and election officials as well.\" The first election was March 29. An announcement of the winner of the presidential election was delayed for weeks as opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai claimed he had won. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, after a long delay, ruled that neither candidate had won the required majority of votes, and scheduled a runoff election for June 27. Since the March balloting, there have been numerous reports from Tsvangirai's party and church groups about kidnappings, torture and other violence, including the deaths of opposition party members. They say the violence targets opponents of Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party. At about the same time Sunday that Mugabe was giving his campaign speech, Tsvangirai was speaking at a funeral.

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe campaigns in the capital of Harare last week. Results were not expected until Sunday. The main opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, alleged widespread irregularities and promised to release its own election results, defying a government order. Critics of the government have predicted that the elections will be rigged or marred by fraud, though the government has promised that they will be \"free and fair.\" At a news conference in Harare, Movement for Democratic Change Secretary-General Tenda Biti said that some of the party's agents have been chased away from polling stations. The party also said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission claimed to have lost the accreditation for agents at 19 stations and refused to let them in. Biti said there was a \"massive\" deployment of soldiers and police at most stations. Journalists inside the country reported a heavy presence of the army and police but disagreed with Biti's description of it as \"massive.\" Police said they were investigating the bombing of a house in Harare belonging to a parliamentarian candidate from Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party. The bombing happened early Saturday, and it was not immediately clear whether it was connected to the elections, police said. No one was inside the home at the time. The Zimbabwean government has denied CNN and other international news organizations permission to enter the country to report on the elections. Read about reporting on the elections. The elections are posing one of the toughest challenges to Mugabe's 28-year rule. Two candidates, both from different factions of the opposition party, stand a good chance of unseating him. One opposition contender is Movement for Democratic Change founder Morgan Tsvangirai, who fought hotly contested challenges against the president in 2000, 2002 and 2005. The other is Mugabe's former finance minister, Simba Makoni. He was a member of the Zanu-PF party until he announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and the party kicked him out. Voter turnout was high after the polls opened at 7 a.m. (1 a.m. ET), journalists reported, but it tapered off throughout the day. Shortly before polls closed at 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET), \"there was a rush of people to put in their last-minute votes\" in some places, media rights activist Reyhana Masters said. Biti also said police were assisting many voters in casting ballots. The opposition has spoken out against \"assistance\" in the voting booth, calling it an intimidation tactic, but Mugabe passed a presidential decree this week that said police could help those voters who are elderly or infirm.  Watch Zimbabweans worry their vote won't count » .

Iden Wetherell, editor of the newspaper Zimbabwe Independent, said the opposition had found large numbers of voters registered at one address where there isn't a building. Voter confusion was also a problem. The elections are not just for president but also for parliamentary, senate and local council seats, meaning voters have to cast a number of ballots in a limited amount of time. Limited voter education means many registered voters were not told which ward to go to and may turn up at the wrong polling stations.  Watch claims of dead voters still on the rolls » . The absence of international media and independent observers has heightened critics' concerns.

An MDC official said this week that leaked correspondence from the electoral commission showed it had asked for 3.3 million more ballots than there are registered voters, including 250,000 extra postal ballots for soldiers and police. Tenda Biti, the opposition's secretary-general, said it was an indication of fraud. A hero of the country's civil war against the white Rhodesian government, Mugabe became the country's first black prime minister in 1980. But nearly three decades later, he has consolidated his rule over all aspects of Zimbabwean life, and the country does not appear better for it. His country was once revered for offering its citizens some of the best education and health care in Africa, but now, schooling is a luxury and Zimbabwe has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world.

Zimbabwean authorities Sunday arrested an opposition leader on charges stemming from his criticism of the government and its handling of the recent presidential election, an official with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change told CNN. Police in Harare surrounded the house of student activist-turned-opposition politician Arthur Mutambara and arrested him on charges of contempt of court and publishing falsehoods, MDC official Romualdo Mavedzenge said.

Both charges stem from an opinion piece written by Mutambara in which he criticized President Robert Mugabe for the way the March 29 elections were handled. Raphael Khumalo, chief executive of The Sunday Standard, which published the article, was arrested last month on charges of publishing falsehoods. Bush said Mugabe's government is failing on multiple levels. \"We call on the regime to immediately halt all attacks and to permit freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and access to the media,\" Bush said. \"We urge the Southern African Development Community, the African Union, the United Nations, and other international organizations to blanket the country with election and human rights monitors immediately.\" Zimbabwe's election commission said Tsvangirai won the March presidential election, but didn't win a majority of the vote, forcing this month's vote.

Chile's military government published information outside the country to make it seem that the victims had died fighting guerrillas. Chilean magistrate Victor Montiglio based his order on an investigation that says 60 victims were illegally arrested by the Office of National Intelligence (DINA) and kept in detention centers before they disappeared. DINA's former director, retired Gen. Manuel Contreras, has already been sentenced to 250 years in prison in other cases involving human rights violations. He found out about Montiglio's ruling in his prison cell. Minister of Justice Carlos Maldonado said the former soldiers will be taken to military compounds after they appear before Montiglio on Tuesday. The civilian suspects will be jailed in the Santiago Uno and Punta Peuco penal facilities, which are outside Santiago, he said.

Chile's government protested the move and said it was calling home its ambassador in Peru, Cristian Barros, for consultations. \"We feel that this type of publication (map) and this position certainly make more difficult a fluid bilateral relationship with the Peruvian government,\" spokesman Ricardo Lagos Weber said on Monday. \"Chile will continue to fully exercise its rights and competencies over Chilean territory,\" he said.

The sea border, set in the 1950s, starts close to the land border and cuts due west across the ocean. But Peru says it was non-binding and rob it of 14,630 square miles (37,900 sq km) of fishing waters. Its proposed border is a southwestern sloping line that follows the diagonal land border into the Pacific Ocean. Analysts say Peru will have its day in court and the Hague is the only venue for the issue to be resolved, unless something happens to escalate the debate. \"The only thing that could happen, which would be very worrisome, would be if some autonomous group carried out some kind of act of sovereignty (in those waters) now that Peru officially claims them.

The church's homeless shelter has become a virtual refugee camp for 800-900 Zimbabweans and a smaller number of migrants from other countries. \"Over the past three years, and more so over the past couple of months, I have noted an exponential increase in the number of people we have from Zimbabwe,\" Bishop Paul Verryn said. Outside his office the line of people waiting for help grew. Many of the new arrivals were asleep in their seats. \"We offer them a place off the streets, where they are protected and have warmth from the inclement streets of Johannesburg,\" Verryn said. At sunset the refugees crowd into the building and lay out reeking blankets. \"People just sleep anywhere they can find a space to sleep. Some people sleep on the steps here, in the corridors and others in the foyer and in the meeting rooms,\" said 27-year-old Walter Rusike from Harare. The commerce graduate and his wife and two children share a meeting room with other families and have been at the shelter for four months. Average said he hoped to get accommodation for a few days until he finds his friend, work or both. \"I have a diploma in stores management and store control, a certificate in security and a driver's licence. I think maybe I will be able to find some work with my qualifications. Anything will be better than the situation I was in,\" he says.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

      "ID: 588, Score: 0.3184, Document: (CNN) -- U.S. President George Bush railed against the government of Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe Monday, calling intimidation of opposition figures \"deplorable.\" Leading opposition figure Artur Mutambara was arrested following his criticism of President Robert Mugabe. \"The continued use of government-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe, including unwarranted arrests and intimidation of opposition figures, to prevent the Movement for Democratic Change from campaigning freely ahead of the June 27 presidential runoff election is deplorable,\" Bush said in a statement released by the U.S. Embassy in neighboring South Africa. Zimbabwean authorities Sunday arrested an opposition leader on charges stemming from his criticism of the government and its handling of the recent presidential election, an official with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change told CNN. Police in Harare surrounded the house of student activist-turned-opposition politician Arthur Mutambara and arrested him on charges of contempt of court and publishing falsehoods, MDC official Romualdo Mavedzenge said. While Zimbabwe authorities have arrested dozens of MDC supporters and activists over the past two months, Mavedzenge said \"this is the highest profile MDC official (arrested) since the March 29 election.\" Mutambara is president of an MDC faction that split from the main party headed by Morgan Tsvangirai. After Tsvangirai's party won the majority of seats in parliament, the two leaders agreed to join forces in parliament under Mutambara's leadership. Both charges stem from an opinion piece written by Mutambara in which he criticized President Robert Mugabe for the way the March 29 elections were handled. Raphael Khumalo, chief executive of The Sunday Standard, which published the article, was arrested last month on charges of publishing falsehoods. Bush said Mugabe's government is failing on multiple levels. \"We call on the regime to immediately halt all attacks and to permit freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and access to the media,\" Bush said. \"We urge the Southern African Development Community, the African Union, the United Nations, and other international organizations to blanket the country with election and human rights monitors immediately.\" Zimbabwe's election commission said Tsvangirai won the March presidential election, but didn't win a majority of the vote, forcing this month's vote. The MDC contested the results, saying Tsvangirai won outright, but decided to take part in the runoff and not cede the election to Mugabe.\n"
